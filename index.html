                <br>I'm a final year Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore. 
                Being a developer and designer myself, I seek to deliver creative and engaging solutions 
                that tackle real-world business challenges. I have profound knowledge in visual design 
                and is heavily involved in front-end development and UI/UX roles. I laid my foundations 
                in ZALORA and small start-ups backed by A*Star. There, I engage with customers to uncover 
                insights to build an understanding of their problems. My work stresses on the empathetic 
                understanding of pain points faced by customers to deliver the best user experience.

                  <h3 class="text-uppercase">Overview</h3>
                  <p><span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight: bold;"> I </span>was rummaging through my college notes to see if there was anything worth keeping while cleaning up my room. I stumbled across a few sketches (see pictures below) of what seemed like a bicycle lock. I was soon reminded of the amount of time, effort, blood, sweat and tears that went into this project. It was actually part of a college coursework (known as “Project Work”) that I had taken in the past. Those studied in a local college should be familiar with the subject, and <b>yes, I agree with you</b><i> - it was a nightmare.</i> The project is usually done in a group of five with several topics to choose from. As far as I can recall, we selected the topic “Risk” only to risk ourselves. As this was my first ever design-related project, I thought it will be cool to revisit it after acquiring some knowledge of UIUX in recent years.</p>
                  <figure>

                  </figure>
                  <p>The topic that we are dealing with is "Risk." It was a rather broad topic, and my group felt that we needed to zoom-in on an everyday challenge faced by society. A couple of ideas were brought on the table, but none of them were as prominent as bicycle theft. With a myriad of bicycle theft and illegal dismantling occurring in public areas, cyclists risk having their bicycle stolen or vandalized. The issue demanded societal attention and is a suitable area to address. To find out how severe the problem is, preliminary research was carried out with the intention to devise a solution to help address it.</p>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Problem / Target Audience</h4>
                  <p>Bicycle is a simple mode of transportation, with a long history that dates back to the 19th century. Despite the rise in popularity of cars and buses over the years, many still rely on bicycles to commute to work, especially in rural areas. Automobile, on the other hand, is often regarded as a luxury good which not everyone can afford. People would resort to bicycle as a cheaper alternative. The high usage of bicycles has however led to related theft in society.</p>
                  <p><i>“As recently as 1965, world production of cars and bikes was essentially the same, with each at nearly 20 million, but as of 2003 bike production had climbed to over 100 million per year compared with 42 million cars. Bicycle production was 105 million units globally in 2004, a 1.5% increase over 2003.”</i> (WorldWatch Institute).</p>
                  <p>A study by the Singapore Police Force in 2009 revealed an astonishing 1 074 cases of bicycle theft - an increase of 59.1% as compared to 675 cases back in 2008. The number includes examples of bicycles dismantled where certain parts of the vehicle were detached and sold for profit. The actual figure might even be higher as not everyone would report such incidents. The number is expected to rise with the emergence of bicycle sharing service where bicycles are made available to the public for shared use.</p>
                  <p>Don’t believe me? Take a look at yourself.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of bicycle sharing services has resulted in vandalism becoming more widespread.</p>

                  <p><i>“The theft of bicycle is a world-wide problem that nobody is able to solve. There are two types of theft: casual use and professional sale. The casual use theft involves a bicycle left unlocked (hence generally a low-value bicycle) that is ridden somewhere not too far away then, immediately or later, abandoned. … Professional theft for sale is different. The thief possesses special equipment for defeating the typical lock, even the high-security lock, and attacks bicycle which he sells at a profit.”</i> (John Forester. Bicycle Transportation, 1997)</p>

                <h4 class="text-uppercase">User Survey & Findings</h4>
                <p>An online poll was conducted to understand the public view on this matter. The following results were attained from 62 respondents.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src='img/t-lock/result_1.png' class="responsive"/>

                    <img src='img/t-lock/result_6.png' class="responsive"/>
                </figure>
                <p>Based on the survey result, more than half of the respondents own a bicycle despite tough competition from alternate means of transport. 47% of the respondents have personally experience bicycle theft or had witness one beforehand, suggesting a notable problem in the society. The problem appears to be more severe amongst those who had experienced it as not many bothered to make a police report. When questioned why many claims that it is difficult to seek external help in retrieving their vehicle; the reason being is that their vehicles would be disfigured beyond recognition by the time investigation begins.</p>
                <p>When evaluating their security practices, more than half claimed to have secure their vehicle with some form of security measure with the most common one being cable lock as it is relatively cheaper compared to other methods. Despite this, 70% of the surveyees still express insecurity in leaving their bicycles unattended. It indirectly suggested that the existing practices were incapable of providing cyclists the confidence they seek when securing their vehicle.</p>
                <p>The above findings affirm our preconceived notion that bicycle theft is prominent and deserving of our attention to finding a solution to tackle it. </p>

                <p>Observations from the above examples suggest that a critical criterion for a good security device lie in its material; it needs to be sturdy enough to resist tampering. The stronger the material, the better it is at withstanding the impact of hand tools but at the same time, priced at a much higher value. Most of these products are also designed to be attached to a stationary object affixed to the ground for added security.</p>
                <p>However, these devices suffer from two common problems – <i>portability</i> and <i>inadequate protection.</i> Sure, a user can always rely on multiple devices for extra security, but at the expense of forking out more money. After all, we have to keep in mind the law of diminishing return where marginal gains from increased purchase decrease with the rising cost.</p>
                <p>We will revisit these factors when designing a prototype in the next section.</p>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Prototyping</h4>
                  <p>Our first attempt at prototyping seeks to address two factors mentioned in the previous section: <b>portability</b> and <b>inadequate protection.</b> It needs to be done without compromising on its robustness against tampering.</p>
                  <p>We hence came up with the following design:</p>
                  <p><u>External Structure</u></p>
                  <figure>
                      <img src='img/t-lock/external_structure.png' class="responsive"/>
                  </figure>
                  <p><u>Internal Structure</u></p>
                  <figure>
                      <img src='img/t-lock/internal_structure.jpg' class="responsive"/>
                  </figure>
                  <p>The above design comprises of four main features:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                      <li>1. Bluetooth technology</li>
                      <li>2. Automatic Wheel Clamp</li>
                      <li>3. GPS functionality</li>
                      <li>4. Motion Alarm Sensor</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
              </section>
              <section id="Portability">
                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Portability: Bluetooth Technology + Automation</h4>
                  <p>We understand that users prefer to have such devices kept as light as possible so that they can carry them around easily.  We applied Nielson’s heuristics and completely do away with the need for users to take any forms of devices with them wherever they go. Recall Nielson’s Heuristics, H7 which states that <b>a good design should be flexible enough to give users the ability to perform a task at an accelerated performance.</b>This was achieved via Bluetooth technology and the use of automation.</p>
                  <p>The idea was inspired by an application called <i>Proximity</i> that leverages on the default Bluetooth technology in computers to keep them secure. Our prototype can perform the same by tapping on the power of Bluetooth technology from a third-party device, that is, the user’s cell phone. In other words, the key to locking and unlocking a bicycle is the users’ cell phone that are normally kept by their side. By pairing both devices, a specific set of instructions can be issued to the prototype via a designated application. For this to work, the prototype first needs to be attached to the back of the bicycle near the seat tube - an area which poses the least hindrance to a cyclist. Once that is done, pressing a button on the cell phone is akin to locking and unlocking a vehicle, dismissing the need for any physical interaction. For instance, switching to a lock state would send a signal to the prototype to automatically clamp shut the rear wheel of the vehicle. The same logic applies to unlock as well. The prototype is left permanent on the vehicle throughout the entire course of securing it. </p>
                  <p>The technology not only saves users the hassle of carrying the prototype device but also spare them from the headache of misplacing a key should there be one. Additionally, any future extension of commands is done through the app without additional cost incurred. In the event where a bicycle got stolen, its whereabouts can be tracked using the same application which utilizes the GPS functionality on the phone. This is possible since the device and the user’s cell phone are always connected.</p>
                  <p>However, one pitfall of this design is the need for users to charge their device occasionally, similar to any other electronics. Charging can either be done via cable or a portable charger. </p>

              <section id="InadequateProtection">
                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Inadequate Protection: Motion Alarm sensor</h4>
                  <p>To provide additional deterrence against theft, the device features a motion sensor that detects any large movement by the bicycle. Should there be one, an inbuilt alarm is raised to sound off the public. It aims to intimidate the offender to cease all activities and flee. If a user still finds it to be inadequate in preventing theft, they are most welcome to use other security devices alongside with the prototype.</p>

              <section id="ExpertReview1">
                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Expert Review by Alpera McAuliffe International Pte Ltd</h4>
                  <p>We were privileged to be able to consult an expert from Alpera McAuliffe International Pte Ltd, an international organization that specializes in renting bicycles and retail trade for more than 20 years.</p>
                  <p>He identified several flaws in our design:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                        <li>1. The extra weight incurred by the device and motion sensor would drastically increase the overall weight of the bicycle. This impede the mobility of the vehicle.</li>
                        <li>2. The exorbitant cost involved in creating the product; it entails the procurement of a Bluetooth transceiver, motion sensor, alarm system and cost of assembling the parts together. Users with bicycle that are cheap would not find the product appealing as the cost of the product outweighs the cost of actually owning a bicycle.</li>
                        <li>3. The need to fall back to traditional locking methods to ensure that no-one, but the user is capable of detaching the device from the vehicle. Doing so actually defeat the purpose of using Bluetooth technology and automation to secure a bicycle.</li>
                        <li>4. Should a phone gets stolen, the culprit will acquire full control over the vehicle. A password-protected phone can easily be unlocked using a decryption software</li>
                        <li>5. Need to ensure that the Bluetooth connection is distinctive so that the device only recognizes the user’s cell phone and not other devices with a similar app installed.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>We decided to revise our prototype based on the above feedback.</p>
              </section>
              <section id="RevisedPrototype">
                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Revised Prototype</h4>
                  <p>Our second shot at prototyping turns out to be vastly different from its predecessor. The design seeks to address the flaws that were previously overlooked by us.</p>
                  <p>To tackle the problem of high cost and heavy weight encountered in the previous design, we decided to model it as a shared system which everyone can use. That way, cost for using the service can be kept low as manufacturing cost is shared among users. The pricing is based on the duration of usage so that it is economical and practical for cyclists who do not park their vehicle often. The design is similar to a bicycle rack, but the key difference is that it helps cyclists secure their bicycles without additional equipment. The system comes with ten gantries (or parking lots) and can hold up to ten vehicles. Each gantry is responsible for securing the front wheel of a bicycle. In terms of security, the rack is mounted on the ground, rendering it completely immobile yet sturdy enough to resist any forms of cutting and heating. Ideally, they are to be situated in areas with strict surveillance containing heavy human traffic such as the MRT stations as an added form of deterrence against theft.</p>
                  <figure>
                      <img src='img/t-lock/t_lock_improved.png' class="responsive"/>
                  </figure>
                  <p>The system uses Quick Response (QR) technology and lever handles to toggle between the state of the gantry (i.e., lock and unlock). Users would first need to download an app available on the Google play store or the Apple app store and register a payment method. Users will proceed to scan the QR label on a vacant gantry using the same app (Note that QR label are unique by default). To lock a vehicle, users simply have to lower down the lever affix to the same gantry to slam shut their vehicle.</p>
                  <p>Unlike its predecessor, there is no need to perform any prior purchase or configuration other than registering on the app itself. Other features such as wheel clamp and automatic sensor still hold but this time, concealed within the rack. Although this design does not come with tracking capabilities featured in the previous model, bicycle owners will nonetheless be alerted of any unauthorized movement of their vehicle through their mobile.</p>
                  <p><b>To lock your bicycle:</b>
                      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                          <li>1. Installed the specified app on Google play store or Apple app store. Register a payment method.</li>
                          <li>2. Find a vacant gantry and scan its QR label. Ensure that the gantry is in working order.</li>
                          <li>3. Push vehicle into the gantry</li>
                          <li>4. Lower down the lever affix to the same gantry to lock your vehicle.</li>
                          <li>5. Monitor the status of your vehicle through the app.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p><b>To unlock your bicycle:</b>
                      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                          <li>1. Open the same app used to secure your vehicle.</li>
                          <li>2. Scan the same QR label on the gantry where the vehicle is parked. Payment is automatically made via the registered method. <i>*The amount payable depends on the parking duration.</i></li>
                          <li>3. Once payment is received, the lever is automatically raised, and the vehicle is released. Remove the bicycle from the rack.</li>
                          <li>4. A summary of your payment will be shown on the app.</li>

                  <p>We wanted to go with a design that users are familiar with. Recall Nielson once spoke about recognition being a far more powerful retrieval process than recall. To avoid users spending time fretting over how to use the system every time, we decided to adopt a mrt-gantry design that appears more intuitive to them. </p>
                  <p>To aid our visualization, we attempt to model it in 3D.</p>

                  <p>The robustness of the gantries lies in the strength of the solenoid. Unlike physical locks whose strength remain relatively constant and cannot be easily adjusted, a solenoid’s strength varies according to the amount of current that is being passed through. It gives us the flexibility to regulate the its strength from time to time. The use of a solenoid is considered to be smooth and fast with little lag time involved.</p>
                  <p>I have written a comprehensive document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WsiSJEOhcmTitHbx-aRfvs1OORSFJPyIpmDRbWYolG8/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:blue"><u>here</u></a> on how a solenoid works in our system.</p>

                  <p>An accelerometer will be installed in the locking rod (or clamp) of each gantry. For an object that is installed with an accelerometer, if tilted at an angle greater than what is set, an alarm will be raised. Any unusual movement of the bicycle will let off the alarm, alerting the public of a possible theft. The sound of alarm can further be amplified by drilling holes onto the rod. </p>

                  <p>As mentioned in the earlier section, the material used to create a device is critical in determining its effective against forcible theft. <i>T-Lock</i> is coated with duplex stainless steel for this purpose. Duplex stainless steel is a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite. Being twice as strong as regular, single layered ferritic stainless steel, it offers better toughness and ductility, able to withstand corrosion which leads to future cost saving in maintaining the system.</p>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Expert Review by Mr. Quek Shu Yang, Co-Founder of GozoLab</h4>
                  <p>We did another round of evaluation, this time with Mr. Quek Shu Yang, who co-foundered GozoLab, a company that rewards consumers for purchasing from selected vendors. As a software engineer and an entrepreneur for over a decade, he possesses a profound knowledgeable in software architecture and is immensely experienced with the start-up scene in Singapore. </p>
                  <p>We touched on the topic of land scarcity and how it could interfere with the implementation of our design.</p>
                  <p>With a total land area of only 719.1 sqkm, Singapore faces the problem of land scarcity. Buildings are often built upwards, and not outwards to reduce land space. Working towards this notion, we improved T-Lock to increase its capacity to hold more vehicles without incurring additional space. This was achieved by introducing a double-sided concept, with ten parking lots on each side. Each lot has an original dimension of 70 x 70 cm. To improve the compactness of the rack, the width of each lot is reduced to about 55cm. This is smaller compared than an average bicycle rack, yet still able to accommodate a good spectrum of bicycle size available in the market. </p>
                  <p>To bring the idea of space efficiency one step forward, we propose the use of a whip antenna – an extendable steel rod to lock the bicycles. Each section of the antenna has a length of 20cm. When extended fully, it measured up to 60cm, effectively covering the 55cm parking lot. When fully retracted it is only 20cm. This effectively reduces the size of the “walls” on each sides the gantry used to house the antennas.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Mr. Quek was also concerned about whether our design is compatible with the surrounding environment. According to him, <i>T-Lock</i> needs to be versatile enough to take on a variety of theme imposed by the location. Ideally, the system is expected to reside in areas that has an abundant of cyclists such as parks or recreational areas. As such, we came up with alternative designs to suit the environment, yet remain eye-catching enough for passers-by to try out our product. However, we need to ensure that its effectiveness against bicycle theft is not compromised by the improvement in appearance.</p>

                  <h4 class="SwotAnalysis">SWOT Analysis</h4>
                  <b>Strength</b><br>
                  <p>One of the biggest merits of our system is portability. Contrary to popular belief, a bicycle lock need not always have to be a personal handheld device; we have demonstrated the possibility of remodelling as a stationary shared point to ease usage. There is little value for cyclists to invest in an advanced, cutting-edge technology only to find out that it outweighs the cost of thier bicycles. Our goal here is to provide an economical, user-friendly yet effective method against bicycle theft. Due to effective cost-sharing among consumer, any modification made to <i>T-Lock</i> would benefit everyone.  This also means that a bigger budget can be granted to making enhancements like using duplex stainless steel in building the locking mechanism. Other feature such as motion sensor previously thought to be infeasible in our first prototype can now be implemented in <i>T-Lock</i> as they only designed to come in during the course of securing a vehicle.</p>
                  <p>Another advantage of using the system is the incorporation of online payment services. We understand that the government is pushing for a “cashless society.” To align with this objective, the use of mobile phone to perform payment would enable the support of a wide variety of popular payments means online. Paying in cash can be a very cumbersome process and may require additional instruments to handle the transactions.</p>
                  <b>Weakness</b><br>
                  <p>It may not be cost-friendly for <i>T-Lock</i> to be implemented in areas that lacks supervision as it could potentially result in vandalism. Vandalism include spray painting and purposeful destruction of the system components resulting in their malfunctioning. Vendors will have to suffer from maintenance cost of vandalized locks and gantries. Additionally, if implemented in desolated areas, the sounding of the motion sensor is less effective and offenders is more likely to get away with theft. Hence it should be implemented in areas with strict supervision to tap on the public surveillance system such as the CCTV and IP camera.</p>
                  <b>Opportunities</b><br>
                  <p>When it comes to seeking sponsorship, there are many cases whereby organizations in Singapore provide funding for similar initiatives. When dug deeper, we found out that our project’s objective coincides with that of Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA). One of the agency's key objective is to promote a healthy living in Singapore as evidenced by the number of related projects rolled out over the years. A notable example would be the establishment of cycling towns in Pasir Ris and Tampines which encourages citizens to choose cycling over driving. With that being observed, it is highly plausible for such government entities such as LTA to support projects that seeks to improve the well-being of cyclists in Singapore. </p>
                  <p>We also took a look at the government’s attitude towards theft. As a non-profit organization, the government body is concerned with the welfare of its citizens. The authorities are looking to inject funds into projects that could potentially reduce the number of theft and vandalism cases in recent years. Therefore, every aspect of <i>T-Lock</i> – from the materials used to the method of implementation – considered the implication of these issues and took a high standard approach to alleviate these problems. </p>
                  <b>Threat</b><br>
                  <p>The lack of a potential market has always been a challenge to new endeavors. With <i>T-Lock</i> being a new entrant to the bicycle lock market, a substantial amount of time is required for the product to instill some brand loyalty in cyclists and establish an association between a good bicycle lock and <i>T-Lock</i> in customers. It is therefore important to work on its marketing strategies by continually advertising the product on popular bicycle sites such as Dirt Bike and Bike Radar forums so that the public would gain more knowledge about <i>T-Lock</i> and encourage its use.</p>
                  <p>Moving forward, we can consider adopting various marketing models such as a reward or membership program to make things more appealing for daily travels. Cyclists can expect to enjoy discounts and hourly specials by fulfilling certain conditions specify by the vendors. </p>

                  <p>The truth is that if a thief is determined to steal a bike, he’s going to do it at all cost. Hence, no single lock is a perfect solution to deter theft. However, having a good lock can make him think twice before committing a theft. Moreover, it is always in the human quest to minimise the risk we encounter. On a final note, T-Lock is not only convenient, durable, and cost effective. It seeks to provide an all-day protection to all bicycles, ensuring that cyclist will never have to fear leaving their bicycles unattended. </p>

              <section id="Overview2">
                  <h3 class="text-uppercase">Overview</h3>
                  <p><span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight: bold;">I've</span> been involved in Orbital for almost four years now. For those who are unaware of what this program entails, you can find more information about it through this <a href=" https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/" style="color:blue">link</a>. What kept me going back as an advisor, instructor or TA is the opportunity given to share my knowledge as a UIUX designer. One thing that I’ve noticed with most students is that they tend to face the problem of decision fatigue. They spend too much time debating on which design fares better rather than working on the actual prototype itself.</p>
                  <p>Given the many guidelines on the internet, it can be difficult to decide which design principles to adhere to, as sticking to all of them is impossible. The post seeks to address this problem. I have specifically chosen five UIUX guidelines to talk about in this post. I find them to be highly practical as I follow them 90% of the time when designing for a product that needs to be quickly delivered.</p>
                  <p>Before I begin, I would like to regurgitate that <b>UI IS NOT UX and vice versa</b> - <i>I often lumped these two terms together, but do take note that they have very different meaning as mentioned in this <a href="https://codeburst.io/ux-is-not-ui-what-is-the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design-4c330c5002e31 “style="color:blue">article</a>.</i></p>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tip #1: 6:3:1 Rule</h4>
                  <p>When comes to designing an interface, be sure to use a consistent set of colors. Recall that Nielson once spoke about consistency and standards when designing. You do not want to confuse your users with too many colors. As a rule of thumb, try to sticks to three colors, i.e., primary, secondary and accent. Designers usually do not have much trouble with this; they tend to fret over color proportion instead. There is an old interior design rule that can be extended to modern application design that many are familiar with. It suggests that you pick three different colors and use them in the ratio of 60%, 30% and 10% to bring balance into the composition.</p>
                  <figure>
                        <img src="img/5_tips_and_tricks_to_quickly_deliver_a_prototype/6_3_1_rule.png" class="responsive">
                  </figure>
                  <p>The rule can be interpreted as follows:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>60% of your interface should be made up of your primary colors. The primary color is your dominant color and is used for large elements like the background of your interface.</li>
                      <li>30% of your interface should be filled with the secondary color. It is meant for common widgets such as the navigation bar and side menu. Some designers prefer to work with two secondary colors, allocating 15% to each to differentiate the widgets. However, I prefer sticking to one color to avoid confusing my users unless I am very proficient in using colors.</li>
                      <li>The remaining 10% is your accent colors. DO NOT USE THEM FREELY. Use them strategically. The color is mainly for smaller elements which require heavy emphasis. These include your buttons, CTA, and icons – anything that is critical to your app conversion.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Here’s an example of how this rule works:</p>
                  <figure>
                      <img src="img/5_tips_and_tricks_to_quickly_deliver_a_prototype/6_3_1_example.png" class="responsive">
                  </figure>
                  <p>Pretty neat huh? However, be careful with your choice of colors. Make sure you have at least one pair of contrasting colors to provide sufficient visibility for your users. Also, ensure that your colors harmonize well with each other. The easiest way to do this is to use a color scheme generator – One of my favorite tools to do this is <a href="https://coolors.co/ " style="color: blue">coolors.co</a>.</p>

              <section id="tip-2">
                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tip #2 Selecting Font Sizes</h4>
                <p>Designers tend to neglect the fact that font sizes can be as equally powerful as colors in representing information. As the number of colors is confined to the 30-60-10 rule, you may need to resort to using font size to differentiate between  elements. Like colors, each font size corresponds to a different degree of emphasis. I like to work with five categories of font size: extra-small, small, medium, large and extra-large. Each font size is calculated by adding an offset to an exponential number of a fixed base. The offset gives you a default size to work with while the exponent gives you a consistent scaling from one size to another. The following is a set of font sizes used by one of my prototypes, calculated using the formula (12 + 2^n).</p>                <figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/5_tips_and_tricks_to_quickly_deliver_a_prototype/font_sizes.png" class="responsive">
                </figure>
                <p><i>*Note that your size may vary based on the resolution of the screen you are designing for.</i></p>
                <p>Here’s couple of benefits of using a standard set of font sizes:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none">
                    <li>1. Improves data consumption through better legibility</li>
                    <li>2. Creates consistent user experience</li>
                    <li>3. Eliminates decision fatigue when designing</li>
                    <li>4. Consistent scalability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The same concept can be applied to spacing and sizing your element as an alternative to a n-pt grid system. However, make sure that you use even number like 10 to size and space your element to accmodate a wide variety of devices.</p>

              <section id="tip-3">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tip #3: Storyboard</h4>
                    <p>If you can choose only one technique to illustrate your user flow, my suggestion is to go with a storyboard. A storyboard is a combination of every method that attempts to demonstrate how a product could achieve a user’s goal. It is defined as a “story communicated through a sequence of images that chronologically maps the story’s main events.” It is more powerful in conveying an idea than just words as pictures are known to speak a thousand word. The true beauty of a storyboard lies in its ability to break down a complex idea into smaller steps - allowing designers to explore the user experience more in-depth. By narrating a user story through a series of pictures, designers can predict how a user would interact with the interface at any point in time, revealing any flaws and misassumption in-between.</p>                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/5_tips_and_tricks_to_quickly_deliver_a_prototype/storyboard.png" class="responsive">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Before attempting to draw a storyboard, it is important to first define your user goals followed by your product feature – otherwise your storyboard will easily lose focus. A good storyboard maps back to the user’s objective. One way to do this is start off by visualizing the first and last step followed by the intermediate steps required to accomplish a task. That way, you are doing yourself a favour by setting up the conditions necessary to think in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>Last but not least, only include details that matter in your drawing – the purpose of a storyboard is to visualize your user journey and by no means, an assessment to your drawing ability.</p>

              <section id="tip-4">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tip #4: User Testing</h4>
                    <p>The fastest way to test your prototype without incurring excessive cost is to use a third-party application. My colleague had recently introduced me to this online tool known as <a href=" https://maze.design/”style="color: blue">Maze</a>. It allows designers to perform user testing online. <b>Yes, you heard it right:</b> <i>online</i>.  How it works is that it imports your mock-up from sites such as <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/”style="color: blue">Invision</a> and <a href=”https://marvelapp.com/” style="color: blue">Marvel</a> to create specific user tasks that can be shared with others via a public link. The first task is free of charge, but the subsequent ones require money. But overall, it provides you the analytics needed to assess the performance of your prototype. It even deploys heat map technology to determine the number of clicks in various regions of a screen.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/5_tips_and_tricks_to_quickly_deliver_a_prototype/maze.png" class="responsive">
                    </figure>
                    <p><i>*I am by no means afflicted to the site - just a big fan of it.</i></p>
                    <p>However, for someone who seek rigor in user testing, the above method might not be suitable. In that case, you’ll be are better off using statistical test to evaluate your prototype. I have demonstrated how to go about doing this using the theory of HCI <a a href="" style="color: blue">here</a>.</p>

              <section id="tip-5">
                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tip #5: Educate the people around you</h4>
                <p>Nothing beats getting things done quicker than ensuring that everyone is on the same page. Although this  advice is not as technical as the others, I cannot emphasize this enough due to the number of misunderstandings that arise from misusing terminologies.</p>
                <p>Different people have a different interpretation of the same technical term depending on their background. It can be challenging to convey a specific design when working together on the same project. I recalled one instance when working with a client as a freelancer. The person requested for the “thingy that can be slide left and right” on his mobile app. It took me quite some time to realize that he was actually referring to the switch button. <i>Shocking right?</i> Well, I do not blame him as he is not accustomed to using design vocabulary on a day-to-day basis. However, this does not give you an excuse not to educate the people around you. Even if you are unable to meet them on a daily basis, be sure to explain any jargons that people might use at the start of every meeting. Miscommunication is probably the last thing you want to experience when faced with a tight deadline. Imagine discovering that your design is completely off from what others envisioned when significant progress is already made – not only does it cost you time but it also undermines your ability as a designer.</p>
                <p><i>Here are some glossaries which I find to be helpful:</i></p>

                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tip #5: Educate the people around you</h4>
                <p>As this is an extension to the first two tips, I decided to add this as a bonus tip instead. So, what happens when you run out of colors and font sizes to differentiate your components? Don’t forget a color comprises of hue, saturation, and value; modifying these values will allow you to obtain different variation of the same color. However, color variations are hierarchal and commonly used to represent a different state of the same element. Human cognition is designed to group similar color and associate them with a particular meaning. When applying a color variation to a component, make sure that it has some form of connection to other components that uses a different color variation as well.</p>
                <p>So how do we modify a <i>color</i> to get good variations? As a general guideline, decreasing a color’s brightness and increasing its saturation will increase its intensity while doing the opposite will lighten the intensity. <i>Erik D.Kennedy</i> had written a splendid <a href=" https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/color-in-ui-design-a-practical-framework-e18cacd97f9e " style="color: blue">article</a> on how to go about doing this.</p>

                <p>Combining this with tip #1, you can quickly do up a style guide like this:</p>

                  <h3 class="text-uppercase">Conclusion</h3>

                  <p>The tips that I’ve shared are what works for me; you may find some of them useful and others to be irrelevant. It is up to you as a designer to make sense of what is best for your product. However, I must stress the importance of working with a set of guidelines as it enforces some consistency over your designs.</p>
